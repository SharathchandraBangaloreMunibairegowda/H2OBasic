This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

I will be writing a simple code below to install h2o package, hosting the h2o server, performing analysis using machine learning algorithm and finally creating a high accuracy model.

Install h2o package by running the command install.packages("h2o") and follow up with code below. Initiating H2O with all cores in use and max memory of 4 GB allocated from the system - Getting an error as memory is exceeding and H2O works better in 64-bit JAVA. 

You can access the server hosted on the localhost. By hitting the URL, http://localhost:54321/flow/index.html and all the below operations can be carried on. 

H2O Cloudframe is open source and provides great results with reliable machine learning algorithms inbuilt in the package. 

Invoking the library and running the h2o server.
```{r}
library(h2o)
h2o.init(nthreads = -1)
```

Reading a data spreadsheet to H2O Cloud Reading from URL or from local. Thus, I have imported data from local.
```{r}
dataset <- h2o.importFile("C:/Users/Sharathchandra B M/Desktop/iris_wheader.csv",destination_frame = "tryout")
```

Predicting values for column - "class", thus assigning that column
```{r}
y <- "class"
x <- setdiff(names(dataset), y)
```

Splitting of dataset. To create test dataset and train dataset. Train dataset has 80% of data and test dataset has 20% of data.
```{r}
parts <- h2o.splitFrame(dataset,0.8)
train <- parts[[1]]
test <- parts[[2]]
```

Fitted Model created based on values got from train dataset.
```{r}
model <- h2o.deeplearning(x,y,train,model_id = "ModelusingDeepLearning")
summary(model)
```

Predict values and check alongside test data (Testing the model). Confusion Matrix has been displayed.
```{r}
predict <- h2o.predict(model,test)
h2o.confusionMatrix(model)
```

Creating a dataframe of predicted values and actual values
```{r}
display <- as.data.frame(h2o.cbind(predict$predict,test$class))
display
```

Accuracy of the model
```{r}
mean(predict$predict==test$class)
```

Shutdown the h2o server instance.
```{r}
h2o.shutdown()
```
